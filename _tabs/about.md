My name is Jude and this is my blog! I have been working in cybersecurity for just over 2.5 years as of late 2023, and I am currently a Security Analyst 2 at Oracle. The main purpose of this project is to develop my technical writing skills through documenting my cybersecurity journey. 

I will primarily post about building out a security-focused homelab. This will include typical blue team items, such as network and endpoint threat detection and response, malware analysis, secure network design, honeypot analysis, and much more. I'll also dive into some red team topics primarily consisting of CTF writeups. 

Out of personal preference I will be using open source solutions for any given objective when available.

Feel free to reach out on LinkedIn if you have any questions about the content on this blog!
