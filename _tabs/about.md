I'm Jude and this is my blog! As of May 2024, I have been in the security field for just over 3 years and currently work as a Security Analyst at Oracle. The main goal of this blog is to document my journey in building out my home environment to match the quality and capabilities of an enterprise-grade setup.

Out of personal preference, I will be using open-source solutions for any given objective when available.

Feel free to reach out via LinkedIn if you have any questions about the content on this blog!
