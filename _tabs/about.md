My name is Jude and this is my blog! The main purpose of this project is to develop my technical writing skills through documenting my cybersecurity journey. 

I will primarily post about building out a security-focused homelab which will include typical blue team items including: network & endpoint threat detection and response, malware analysis, secure network design, honeypot analysis, and much more. I'll also post some red team topcis primarily consisting of CTF writeups. 

My current experience with using and securing containers is fairly limited, so I plan on using them for the task at hand whenever possible.

Feel free to reach out on LinkedIn if you have any questions about the content on this blog!
